2. **1960s - Early Enthusiasm:**
    - **Unimate:**
        - In 1961, the first industrial robot named Unimate began operating on assembly lines at a General Motors factory.
        - Developed by George Devol and Joseph Engelberger, Unimate revolutionized manufacturing by automating repetitive tasks, marking a significant advancement in robotics and automation.
    - **ELIZA:**
        - In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, one of the earliest natural language processing (NLP) computer programs.
        - ELIZA utilized simple pattern matching techniques to simulate conversation, demonstrating early attempts at human-computer interaction and sparking interest in NLP research.

These developments exemplify the pioneering efforts in robotics with the introduction of Unimate and the exploration of human-computer interaction through the creation of ELIZA during the 1960s, contributing to the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence.
