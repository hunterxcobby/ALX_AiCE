        - The Turing Test stimulated discussions on the nature of intelligence and laid the groundwork for future AI research.
    - **John McCarthy and the Dartmouth Conference:**
        - In 1956, John McCarthy, along with Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and Nathaniel Rochester, organized the Dartmouth Conference, where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined.
