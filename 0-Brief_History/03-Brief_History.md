A period marked by the onset of the first AI Winter, which significantly impacted the progress of artificial intelligence research:

3. **1970s - AI Winter Begins:**
    - **Reduced Funding and Interest:**
        - Between 1974 and 1980, the field of artificial intelligence experienced the first AI Winter, characterized by a downturn in funding and waning interest in AI research.
        - This period was driven by a sense of disillusionment with the perceived lack of progress and overhyped expectations regarding the capabilities of AI technologies.
    - **Impact on Research:**
        - The AI Winter led to a decline in funding for AI projects, causing many researchers and organizations to shift their focus away from artificial intelligence towards other areas of computer science.
        - Despite the challenges, some researchers continued their work in AI, laying the groundwork for future advancements during subsequent periods of resurgence in interest and funding.

The onset of the first AI Winter in the 1970s reflects a critical juncture in the history of artificial intelligence, highlighting the challenges faced by the field and its resilience in the face of adversity.
