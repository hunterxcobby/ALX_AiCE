4. **1980s - A Renewed Hope:**
    - **Rise of Expert Systems:**
        - In 1980, the emergence of Expert Systems breathed new life into the field of artificial intelligence.
        - Expert Systems were computer programs designed to emulate the decision-making abilities of human experts in specific domains, showcasing the practical applications of AI and reigniting interest in the field.
    - **Second AI Winter (1987-1993):**
        - Despite the initial optimism surrounding Expert Systems, the field experienced its second AI Winter between 1987 and 1993.
        - This downturn was triggered by multiple factors, including the collapse of the market for Lisp machines, which were widely used for AI research, and disappointment with the limitations of Expert Systems in delivering on their promises.

The 1980s witnessed a dual narrative in the history of artificial intelligence, with the rise of Expert Systems bringing renewed hope followed by the onset of the second AI Winter, characterized by challenges and setbacks that once again dampened enthusiasm for AI research.
